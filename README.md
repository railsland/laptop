Laptop
======

Laptop is a set of scripts to get your laptop set up as a development machine.

It should take about 45-60 minutes for everything to install, depending on your machine.

Mac OS X
--------

First, install [GCC for OS X](https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer). (requires OS X 10.6 or higher)

Then, run this one-liner:

    bash < <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/railsland/laptop/master/mac)

Ubuntu
------

First, install [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/download).

Then, run this one-liner:

    bash < <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/railsland/laptop/master/ubuntu)

If you're setting up Ubuntu for one of our workshops, we recommend you also install gEdit for your text editor.
You can [customize it with these instructions](http://blog.sudobits.com/2011/04/02/textmate-for-ubuntu-linux/).
